## pcrappyfuzzer

pcrappyfuzzer.py: a very simple mash-up of Scapy + [radamsa](https://github.com/aoh/radamsa) to extract data from a PCAP file and perform quick 'n dirty fuzzing ad infinitum.

Originally written for a penetration testing engagement, but modified to support the blog post "Fuzzing proprietary protocols with Scapy,
radamsa and a handful of PCAPs" published in [https://blog.blazeinfosec.com](https://blog.blazeinfosec.com)
